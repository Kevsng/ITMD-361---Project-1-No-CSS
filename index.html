    <h1>Dinosaurs</h1>
    <p>Dinosaurs back in the day were a very large and diverse group spread out through a vast distance of time. They dominated land ecosystems for more than 150 million years during the Mesozoic Era. Fossils have shown their incredible range of body sizes and how diverse their diets, behaviors, and other things were. Some of them walked on two legs, while others on four, and then there are many who can switch in between each.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, Paleontologists usually have grouped dinosaurs into two major clades based on their hip structure. The saurischians, which usually includes theropods and sauropodomorphs, and the ornithischians, which then include plated, horned, and duck-billed dinosaurs. These categories help scientists around the world to compare the anatomy and trace evolutionary relationships across time.</p>

    <p>One example of a dinosaur that I really like is a theropod known as the Tyrannosaurus Rex. They were known to be mostly carnivorous and had hollow bones with three-toed limbs. An example of a sauropod is a Brachiosaurus, which had a long neck and would eat plants from extreme heights. Ornithischians included some famous dinosaurs known as the Triceratops and Stegosaurus with their elaborate horns, frills, and their plates that were there as display and maybe defense functions.</p>

    <p>The fossil record not only records fossils from the past, but also trackways, nests, and rarely rare-soft-tissue impressions. These clues suggested to us the complex behaviors that some species had, like how they nested in colonies, guarded eggs, or moved into herds. Growth rings also appeared in bone cross-sections that allowed scientists to estimate the age and development, showing how many dinosaurs grew quickly.</p>

    <p>Most if not all non-avian dinosaurs vanished at the end of the Cretaceous in a mass extinction event. Evidence showed us that a large asteroid impacted earth alongside volcanic activity and climate stress. Birds are considered living dinosaurs because they descend from small feathered theropods, so in a real sense dinosaurs are still with us today.</p>
